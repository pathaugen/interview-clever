	<h2>Sr. Level Full-Stack Developer</h2>
</div>


<p>
	My work with education agencies such as CalCRN at the CDE gives me the appriciation and love for the work Clever is doing.
</p>
<p>
	For that agency, I worked directly under the director - Charlsey Cartwright - all the way until her retirement as a full-stack developer creating the backend for multiple education websites and projects.
</p>
<p>
	That was years ago, and only a small part of my experience.
	Since then I've made friends with teachers starting private schools having donated my time developing full-stack systems from scratch for them among other SMB work that is non-education related.
</p>
<p>
	Most of this current work is Python based RESTful driven AJAX/JSON systems developed full-stack with libraries and APIs such as jQuery mixed with whatever I may be integrating
	(LinkedIn, iContact, Clever, etc.).
</p>
<p>
	Your development house uses Python which I have huge experience with, Coffeescript which is a simplified javascript which I have mastery over, and while I don't utilize Go by choice,
	I want to emphasize that my experience in multiple languages gives me the ability to quickly swap from one to another quickly and efficiently. Especially these quick and simple languages.
</p>
<p>
	I can offer my excellent JS skillset which integrates with Coffeescript, my vast Python experience,
	and my unique mix of analytical and creative thoughts which are already thinking up some fun "Clever Talk" subjects.
</p>


<h2>Competent</h2>

<p>
	RELEVENT SKILLS: Python language, SQL/NoSQL data backends, JSON data manipulation, RESTful design of system backends, JS/jQuery AJAX near-offline and quick-load full system integrations.
</p>
<p>
	PROOF OF SKILL: Willingness to rise above other candidates by rapidly developing a proof of skill custom Python NoSQL example application to demonstrate competency. Clean code proof, with documentation, and jQuery layer for AJAX JSON grabs and manipulation for polish to rise above.

</p>


<h2>Capable</h2>

<p>
	ABOVE AND BEYOND: With senior level skills across multiple relevant disciplines that comes with being a full-stack developer for over 15 years, extra skills brought to the table include mastery of CSS and HTML5 font-end web development, vector-based graphical mastery via Adobe Illustrator for concepts and project elements, and an attitude that never settles and works hard for the best product result adding all the polish possible.
</p>


<h2>Compatible</h2>

<p>
	TEAM PLAYER: Experience in the education field, love of people and meeting with team to tackle anything that needs to be done in person. Excellent code standards and documentation. Eclipse PyDev skillset with ability to adapt to any IDE and repository. No ego. Willingness to quickly change program features and adapt to new requirements. Great "Clever Talk" ideas brewing.
</p>


<h2>Commitment</h2>

<p>
	NEVER QUITS: Will always see a project to the end and then some. Personally makes sure deployments happen flawlessly. Sticks with contracts beyond the requirements if requested. I can see myself growing with the company for years to come.
</p>


<p style="text-align:center;font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;">
	I will work hard for Clever, to the best of my ability, and see all projects I'm involved with completed with polish.
